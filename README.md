# Repository
This repository contains all artifacts produced for work entitled: A Reactive Microservices based Architecture for Development of Reliable IoT Applications

# Abstract
The Internet of Things has changed the scope of the Internet and it has become a network connecting a myriad of devices of different types. The integration of these heterogeneous devices fosters novel services and applications, generates value-added information and actionable knowledge for the end-user. Nowadays, microservices have been increasingly adopted in the development of IoT applications and services due to the fact that such an architectural style promotes some important properties in IoT, like scalability and extensibility.  Recent researches have analyzed the performance interference of microservices based on edge computing applications. However,  they did not assess the performance impact of characteristics inherent in the use of reactive microservices. In this work, we present an architecture based on reactive microservices for the development of IoT reliable applications on edge computing.  We carried out experiments to assess the performance of  IoT applications that make use of the presented architecture and runs on benchmark scenarios. In addition, we performed load and scalability testing of the IoT application that adopts the architecture components in a hybrid scenario (real devices and emulated devices). The results of the performance evaluation show that the IoT application remained functional during the analysis performed.
